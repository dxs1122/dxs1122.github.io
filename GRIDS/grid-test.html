      <h3>Upbringing</h3>
      <p>John William Coltrane was born on September 23, 1926 in Hamlet, North Carolina to an extended, somewhat musical family. His parents were Alice Blair and John R. Coltrane, who were both amateur musicians and his grandfather, William Blair,
        was a reverend. Unfortunately, at thirteen years old, Coltrane’s father, aunt and grandparents died in 1939, forcing just his mother and one of his cousins to care for him for the rest of his childhood. After moving to Philadelphia in 1943,
        his mother gifted him an alto saxophone. In August 1945, due to the ongoing World War, he enlisted in the US NAVY; the war began to settle down in late 1945, so he moved to Hawaii and played swing music with other Navy musicians. His first
        recording, a session with these musicians, can be heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGnY-axUH0U">here.</a></p>
      <p>When Coltrane was dispatched in August 1946, he returned to Philadelphia and became part of its jazz scene, switching from playing mostly alto saxophone to mostly tenor saxophone. He began to be noticed and hired by bebop pioneers such as Dizzy Gillespie and Jimmy Heath.</p>

      <h3>Solo Albums</h3>
      <p>John Coltrane made himself a name as one of the most influential musicians in jazz history by his making extensive, artistically diverse work. In the late 1950s, he recorded bebop-influenced, ‘standard’-heavy records, such as “Coltrane”, “John Coltrane with The Red Garland Trio” and “Soultrane” under the Prestige label. He also recorded one Blue Note record around the same time, “Blue Trane”.</p>
      <p>At the very end of 1959 to the 1960s, after practicing for hours, Coltrane became hungry for more harmonic content and began to expand upon typical western cadences (II-V), developing what is known today as “Coltrane Changes”. With this new harmony, under his new contract with Atlantic Records, he recorded “Giant Steps”, “Coltrane Jazz” and “My Favorite Things”, which are among the best -elling jazz records of all time.</p>
      <p>In 1961, he signed to Impulse Records, and four years later he released “A Love Supreme”. </p>
      <p>Through Impulse records, Coltrane made his foray into the Avant-Garde. Having been moved by the recordings of avant-garde great, Ornette Coleman, he began to worry less about conventions of playing in time and within tonal centers, focusing more on his spirituality and relationship to god. In the mid to late 1960s, he recorded albums such as “Ascension”, “Sun Ship” and “Interstellar Space” (many of these records were not released until years later).</p>
      <h3>As A Sideman</h3>
      <p><b>The New Miles Davis Quintet</b></p>
      <p>In 1955, Coltrane was called by the great trumpeter, Miles Davis, who asked him to join his new “superband” which would consist Paul Chambers, Red Garland and Philly Joe Jones in the rhythm section. This band earned the title of the “First Great Quintet” for recording four albums, “Cookin’” “Relaxin’” Workin’” and “Steamin’” in a row in 1956 under the Prestige label. This band disbanded shortly after these recordings possibly due to Coltrane’s heroin addiction.</p>
      <p>Coltrane reconnected with Miles’ Band in 1958 and recorded “Kind of Blue” with the assistance of newcomers Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, Cannonball Adderley and Jimmy Cobb. To this day, “Kind of Blue” is the #1 best-selling jazz record of all time.</p>
      <p><b>Thelonius Monk</b></p>
      <p>“Thelonius Monk with John Coltrane” (1961) and “Live at Carnegie Hall” (released 2005)</p>
