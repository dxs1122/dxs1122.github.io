      <h3>Upbringing</h3>
      <p>John William Coltrane was born on September 23, 1926 in Hamlet, North Carolina to an extended, somewhat musical family. His parents were Alice Blair and John R. Coltrane, who were both amateur musicians and his grandfather, William Blair,
        was a reverend. Unfortunately, at thirteen years old, Coltraneâ€™s father, aunt and grandparents died in 1939, forcing just his mother and one of his cousins to care for him for the rest of his childhood. After moving to Philadelphia in 1943,
        his mother gifted him an alto saxophone. In August 1945, due to the ongoing World War, he enlisted in the US NAVY; the war began to settle down in late 1945, so he moved to Hawaii and played swing music with other Navy musicians. His first
        recording, a session with these musicians, can be heard <a href="videos.html">here.</a></p>
